## General Introduction


(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

While models of international relationship have been studied extensively under different pressure components, the effect of a Zombie outbreak on international collaborationa and equilibrium is a question that has not been addressed at all to the best of our knowledge. It is remarkable that the effect of such an intense event has not been look at although the fear of zombies and the threat the present is vivid for many of us. Zombies have the very peculiar (in comparaison to other (sur)-natural creatures such as vampires or aliens) not to be a minority in the strict sense of the term, but instead exactly like human, just zombified. Accordingly, the fear of seeing a loved-one transformed into a flesh-eating ghoul is in that sense different that it could be any of us. The psychological effect of such a non-standard threat as well as the repercussion on the behaviour of large popluation systems such as states should be far from trivial. It is clear that standard assumption of international politics would not be applicable for such an extreme case.
Accordingly, we decided to simulate the inter-state collaboration models in order to see the outcome on a world scale of such an extreme event. While some people might question the validity of such a study (in the end, no Zombie has been observed so far), the applicablity of such a reasoning could extend to more real large-scale epidemological threats or simply, give a line of reasoning for copping with what former U.S. Secretery of Defense Donald Rumsfeld referred as the "unknown unknowns" of international security. Zombies might not be real, but the threat and stress the impose on current world politics collaboration is. 


## The Model

For each state, we define a SZR model that evaluates the evolution of the different populations under studies: susceptibles (S), zombies (Z) and removed (R). The apparition of zombies in one state will start the game. Each state will then evolve on the domestic and international level. The domestic level will follow a standard SIR model, whereas the international level will introduce exchange in the population of suceptible and zombie between the states. These exchanges will be influenced by the state decision on foreign policies such as humanitarian or military politics.
We aim to study the evolution of the repartition of the population in our SZR model on a state-scale and international-state.  
(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

Investigation of the application of the SIR model to a zombie outbreak has already been studied letting fear dark days in the event of such an happening in the human population. However, we would like to deepenth this investigation to a multi-state system to see how interactions between subpopulation may brighten the future of the human race. Moreover, we are interested to see in what extend the different paradigm of international politics, *Realpolitik*, Liberalism and Neoconservatism as defined by Daniel W. Drezner in *Theories of International Politics and Zombies*.
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)
We would like to tackle this question by using a two-level model. Intra-state populations would be modelled by a standard SIR (Kermack-McKendrick) model or an evolution of it that might include quarantined poplutions and more evolved parameters. On the next level, the inter-state relationships would be modelled using Game-Theory under different cost-hypothesis relating to the main paradigms of international relationships. 

## Other

The material necessary for defining our models of zombies and 'zombification' parameters will be extracted from the canon of the Zombie popular media such as 'World War Z', '28 Days Later', 'The Night of the Leaving Deads', etc.
